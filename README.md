# composable-admin

Composable and configurable admin functionality that can be added to an existing Secret Network smart contract.

## Setup
 1. Choose one of the two implementations and add its handle and query messages to yours as an enum variant with a payload.
 2. Call the handle and query functions of the selected implementation inside your match statements in the respective functions.
 Pass `DefaultHandleImpl`/`DefaultQueryImpl` as a parameter if you want the default method implementations.
 3. (Optional) The `#[require_admin]` attribute (found in the root of the crate) is provided which can be used to annotate functions
 that require an admin sender. The "derive" feature which is enabled by default is required for this.
 
## Customization
 If you want to change the implementation of any of the methods, simply create a zero-sized struct and implement the trait(s)
 in your chosen implementation. Since all the methods are implemented as trait defaults, it is possible to override only the desired
 methods in your `impl`. Then in step 2 above, pass your struct instead of `DefaultHandleImpl`/`DefaultQueryImpl`.
